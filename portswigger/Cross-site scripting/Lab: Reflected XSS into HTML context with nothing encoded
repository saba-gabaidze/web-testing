Lab: Reflected XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded
Difficulty: Apprentice

This one was super straightforward. The search function reflects user input straight into the HTML without any kind of filtering or encoding. So the goal is simple: trigger a basic alert(1) using XSS.

I opened the lab, looked at the search box, and typed in:

<script>alert(1)</script>
Clicked "Search" and boom — it popped.

That’s it. Lab solved.

Why it works

The app takes whatever you type into the search bar and injects it directly into the page’s HTML. Since it doesn’t encode special characters like < or >, the browser just interprets the script like normal HTML. That’s classic reflected XSS.

Fix

Sanitize or properly encode all user input before reflecting it back into the page. In this case, escaping special characters would’ve stopped the attack.
