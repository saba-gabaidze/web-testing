Lab: Reflected XSS into a JavaScript string with angle brackets HTML encoded
Difficulty: Apprentice

This lab had a reflected XSS vulnerability inside a JavaScript string on the search page. The tricky part was that angle brackets were encoded, so you couldn’t just inject normal <script> tags. The goal was to break out of the JavaScript string and trigger an alert.

What I did:

First, I typed a random string in the search box and intercepted the request with Burp Suite. Sent it to Burp Repeater to play with it.

Looking at the response, I saw my input reflected inside a JavaScript string, but the angle brackets were encoded as &lt; and &gt;, so normal script tags wouldn’t work.

The trick here was to break out of the string by injecting a payload that closes the current string and then calls alert(1).

I used this payload:


'-alert(1)-'
This closes the existing string, adds a call to alert(1), and then adds some harmless stuff to keep the syntax valid.

To verify, I copied the full URL from Burp Repeater, pasted it into the browser, and the alert popped up as expected.
