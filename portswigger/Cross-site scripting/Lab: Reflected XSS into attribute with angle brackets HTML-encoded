Lab: Reflected XSS into attribute with angle brackets HTML-encoded
Difficulty: Apprentice

This lab has a reflected XSS in the blog search feature, but with a twist — angle brackets are HTML-encoded, so you can’t just inject a normal <script> tag. Instead, the input gets reflected inside a quoted attribute in the HTML.

I started by submitting some random text in the search box to see where and how the input shows up. Using Burp Suite, I intercepted the search request and sent it to Burp Repeater to play around.

Looking at the response, I noticed my input was reflected inside a quoted HTML attribute, meaning I couldn’t just insert angle brackets, since those get encoded and won’t break out of the attribute.

So the trick is to break out of that attribute by injecting a payload that closes the quote and adds an event handler. I replaced my input with this payload:

"onmouseover="alert(1)
This closes the existing attribute value with the first ", then adds an onmouseover event that calls alert(1).

To test it, I right-clicked the search results page, copied the URL, and opened it in a browser. When I hovered my mouse over the element containing the payload, the alert popped up.

That confirmed the XSS worked, and the lab was solved.
